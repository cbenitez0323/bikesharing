## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to show that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines will be succcesful. In order to demonstrate this, ana analysis on the success of a bike-sharing program in New York City was conducted. 

## Results:

  <figcaption>In this visualization we see a bar graph displaying the number of bikes used at each hour. The peak is highlighted and shown to be from 5-7pm, where people are most likely leaving work.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>This line graph breaks down the leangth of use for the bikes. It shows that most bike rides are about five minutes and then the graph below shows the same data but seperated by gender. It shows that the majority of users are male.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>This heatmap visulaization demonstrates which days and time are the bikes used most. It seems the bikes are mostly used on weekdays to commute to and from work as 7-9am and 5-9pm n weekdays are darkest. Then the same heatmap is broken down by gender and shows that males are those that use it the most as it is the heatmap that is most like the left and has the darkest shading.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>This visualization shows a heatmap that compares the usage between customers versus subscribers. The darker the heatmap the more bikes are used and here, male subscribers show the most usage. The pie graph on the right shows that overall the majority of users are subscribers.</figcaption>

## Summary: 
From the visulaizations produced it can be seen that the majority of users are males commuting to and from work. Because the rides are mostly about five minutes it can be inferred that the destinations are farely close and possibly walking distance. Therefore, those most likely to walk to work are the most likely to use the bike-sharing program and because of this they are also likely to subscribe. A visualization that would be helpful to see is to be able to compare where the top starting locations are versus the top stopping locations on the same map to see where crowds are moving. Another visual would be to be able to see the gender versus the birth year of the users data in order to understand the primary demographic that uses the Citi Bike program.
